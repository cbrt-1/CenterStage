## TeamCode Module

Welcome!

### Hardware

This contains the RobotHardware class, which is a centralized class used by the TeleOp and Autonomous OpModes.
It holds all hardware references and common hardware method calls (such as controlling the claw).

### Testing

This contains miscellaneous files not used for competition.

### Vision

This contains vision related files and pipelines for computer vision.

### Competition

The code for the driver control during the TeleOp portion of a match is located in the creatively named "Teleop.java" file.
The other four files are for the autonomous portion of the game. Each one is for the four possible positions our robot can start in.
